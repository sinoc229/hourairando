✓Scatter Number Trader items around internet

✓Add new BMD's for items (key, addons, chips etc) usually obtained in the story

(never ending) Document flags and key items

Randomize Blue/Purple mystery data

Add additonal key item checks that usually get ignored in post game(ie needing cruse ticket to go to oceanliner)

# Legal

This version of the game is based off of SHNecro's continuation of the game. He dosn't maintain a public presence and
seems to be MIA, so if he makes himself known I'll work with him to keep this licensed apropriately.

Due to the orgional game getting shut down, reverse engineered and then updated by an anon it's legal history
history is hard to track, so we're going be assume it's abandonware.

This game and code are licensed STRICTLY under a CC-NC license. You can do whatever you want with it, but if
you try to make money off of it we'll kill you in real roblox.
