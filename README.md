# ShanghaiEXE Freeplay mod
Fork of Shanghai EXE (as of SHNecro's 8/22/23 commit) that faucilitates freeplay, adds unused content and randomization.


# Features
-BMG/PMD randomization
-Optional (but recommended) Open world/postgame start
-Items obtained during the course of the story are redistributed to new BMD's
-Difficulty selection (in Alice's PC, the red Sprite)
-Added super chip trader
-Number Trader items are now spread around new BMD's
-Style are now aproximently 4 times faster to aquire
-Added in hidden Gauntlet fights that reward new chips (or whatever the randomizer decides to give!)
-Added new Mega and Dark chips, and a few previously unobtainable chip codes
-Added refights for bosses that previously lacked them (Okuu, Kikuri)
-Relaxed a couple of the Heaven (post game) door requirements to lower grinding in a randomizer setting
-Added previously unseen bosses (Orin, Youmu, Yuyuko, Flandre, Mima)
 --Dark Shanghai and Beast-Out Cir no are in the code but less finished, they may come later once I get comfortable with the boss code
-Added new condition to get to secret final bosses (Get the 4 new navi dark chips)
-Spoiler log for randomizer, if you're stuck
-Capcom copyrighted stuff obliterated from orbit (If i missed anything, please report)

# Future goals
-Region locking/ progression blocking (ie you can't take the metro everywhere from the start)
-Overworld hidden item randomization (Currently not implemented as overworld items share the same functions as progressing side quests, will need a re-write)
-More readable spoiler log
-Clean up the randomization process so that there's not just 2 copies of the maps sitting in the installation folder (i'm a bit stupid)
-Archapeligo (online multiworld) Support

# Maybes
-Encounter randomizer? (Requires re-writing how maps and events are handled, might not do it)
-Grimour Style? (Referenced in in game text but no code exists, will probably be hub style)
-Beast Out Cirno and Dark Shanghai (partialy done in code)

# Known issues
-I can't get the map editor to compile, grab the old one from translator anon's version
-The Debug room causes crashes
-Spoiler log lists internal names of add-ons, not in game names (most of them are romanized versions of the BN equivalents)
-Story mode randomized is largely untested, HIGHLY recomend using the new start if doing randomizer
-Items obtained during the course of the story are redistributed to new BMD's, so story mode is theoreticly harder
-Mima can hit herself, for some reason.
-I'm not finishing up Online PVP. Don't ask.

# Legal

This version of the game is based off of SHNecro's continuation of the game. He dosn't maintain a public presence and
seems to be MIA, so if he makes himself known I'll work with him to keep this licensed apropriately.

Due to the orgional game getting shut down, reverse engineered and then updated by an anon it's legal history
history is hard to track, so we're going be assume it's abandonware.

This game and code are licensed STRICTLY under a CC-NC license. You can do whatever you want with it, but if
you try to make money off of it we'll kill you in real roblox.
