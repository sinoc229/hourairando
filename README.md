# ShanghaiEXE Freeplay mod
Fork of Shanghai EXE (as of SHNecro's 8/22/23 commit) that faucilitates freeplay, randomization and Multiworld compatability.

Currently early in dev, no actual rando features yet. 
Currently only supports freeplay.

The end goal is a fully realised randomizer with Arcapeligo support. 
(Maybe finish up the remaining unfinished chips and Cirno BX, if there's demand)

# Features
Start a new game in the post game, with no side content completed
(at the moment there's no extra blockers, they may be added later once logic is rigurously tested)

Change the difficulty any time at Alice's HP

New boss fights! Youmu, Yuyuko, Orin, Flandre, Mima, and ShanghaiDS are now fixed up and avalible.
(Yuyuko, Orin and Mima don't include navi chips)

New chips! Dark/DX versions of older chips added,as well as a dark chip for Kikuri

Gauntlent fights from the old demo now avalible in the main game, reward otherwise unobtainable chips

Styles are now 4x faster to aquire

Number trader items now spread around new BMD's (located in net Squares)


# Future goals
✓Hijack New Game function to start a freeplay file

✓Reshuffle Pcubes and some barriers to block randomizer ending rather than shortcuts

✓Scatter Number Trader items around internet

✓Add new BMD's for items (key, addons, chips etc) usually obtained in the story

(never ending) Document flags and key items

Randomize Blue/Purple mystery data

Add additonal key item checks that usually get ignored in post game(ie needing cruse ticket to go to oceanliner)

Arcapeligo/Multiworld intigration



# Legal

This version of the game is based off of SHNecro's continuation of the game. He dosn't maintain a public presence and
seems to be MIA, so if he makes himself known I'll work with him to keep this licensed apropriately.

Due to the orgional game getting shut down, reverse engineered and then updated by an anon it's legal history
history is hard to track, so we're going be assume it's abandonware.

This game and code are licensed STRICTLY under a CC-NC license. You can do whatever you want with it, but if
you try to make money off of it we'll kill you in real roblox.
